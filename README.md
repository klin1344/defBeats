# defBeats

Created at PennApps XV 2017.

defBeats is a rasberry pi circuited interface that converts audio into an LED equalizer and synchronized vibration motors to redefine the way that deaf people can experience music. Users can literally feel and see the music they listen to. We believe this will allow deaf users to dance to and enjoy music anywhere, anytime. 

For example in breakdancing, down beats make up almost the entirety of a bboy's sets. This means that for a deaf person who might have felt ostracized from such activities due to their inability to detect such critical components of the form of dance will now be able to fully enjoy such activities.

defBeats is a combination of audio analysis from a microphone input and runs on a python script on a rasbperry pi which acts as a microcontroller for the LED equalizer and vibration motors. Additionally, there is a companion web application using flask, python, html, and css with a database of songs that would work well with defBeats.
